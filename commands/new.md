# Velo — New Work

For starting new work — features, products, or capabilities that don't exist yet. Planning is **mandatory** before any code is written.

For day-to-day work on existing surfaces (bug fixes, refactors, small enhancements), use `/velo:task` instead.

---

## Hard Rule — No Code, Planning Mandatory

**Never write code in new mode.** Not snippets, not pseudocode, not diffs, not patches, not inline fixes. Velo plans, delegates, reviews, and reports — every unit of work goes through `spawn-agent`.

**Always ask before delegating.** Confirm the plan with the user before spawning. Never auto-execute on a vague brief.

**Planning is mandatory.** The PRD and Engineering Design Doc are non-negotiable gates. Do not skip them. Do not hand off to `/velo:task` to bypass them.

**If the user asks Velo to write code, decline (F7).** Offer to route through `/velo:new` agents or stay in the current mode and rephrase.

This rule applies to every state, every failure mode, and every branch of the skill.

---

## Non-Goals

- Writing or editing source code directly (always delegate)
- Bug fixes, refactors, or small enhancements on existing surfaces (→ `/velo:task`)
- Debug investigation (→ `/velo:hunt`)
- Architecture discussions or open-ended design exploration (→ `/velo:yo`)
- Skipping the PRD or Engineering Design Doc gates
- Handing off to `/velo:task` mid-flow to escape the planning gate

---

## Preconditions

The following must be true before the workflow starts. If any precondition fails, the skill cannot run safely.

1. **Adapter concepts available**: `spawn-agent`, `ask-options`, `handoff-mode`, `read-files`, `track-tasks`, `report-cost` are all defined and bound in the runtime adapter.
2. **Runtime capability — agent spawning**: the active runtime supports `spawn-agent`. The workflow below delegates every unit of work; without delegation it cannot proceed.
3. **TEAM.md present and parseable**: agent roster resolves before state `VALIDATE` begins.
4. **PERSONA + ADAPTER imports loaded**: tone rules and adapter concept names resolve before state `VALIDATE` begins.
5. **Runtime capability — option prompts**: `ask-options` is available; without it, gated transitions cannot solicit user choice.
6. **`.velo/tasks/` writable**: planning artifacts must be persistable.
7. **`.velo/products/` readable**: product context retrieval depends on it.

**Fail-fast**: if any precondition fails, print `Cannot start new: precondition failed — <name>: <one-line reason>` and halt. If `spawn-agent` is the missing precondition, print: `/velo:new requires spawn-agent capability, which is not available in the current runtime. Alternatives that may still work: /velo:hunt (debug loop — no delegation) or /velo:yo in Direct mode (concept questions answered without panel spawning).` Do not role-play agents as a fallback — `ADAPTER.md` forbids that.

---

## Telemetry

Event taxonomy and trigger codes follow [Velo Telemetry](skills/velo-telemetry.md). F-codes that fire from this command are F1–F8 per [Velo Failure Modes](skills/velo-failure-modes.md).

**Cap names used by this command**: `cap:edd-cycles` (F2-edd at `EDD_REVIEW`), `cap:review-cycles` (F2-review at `REVIEW_PHASE`).

**Terminal reasons (event 5)**: `delivered-and-committed-and-pushed-and-pr-opened`, `delivered-and-committed-and-pushed`, `delivered-and-committed`, `delivered-no-commit`, `abandoned-prd-review`, `abandoned-edd-review`, `abandoned-review`, `abandoned-ship-gate`, `abandoned-user`, `abandoned-f2-<phase>`, `abandoned-f5`, `abandoned-f6`, `abandoned-f7`, `abandoned-f8`, `cancelled-validate`, `preflight-failed`. F5, F6, F7, F8 abandons fold into `abandoned-user` if user-gated; otherwise emit explicit `abandoned-f<N>`.

---

## Workflow state machine

States:

- `VALIDATE` — read request, apply requirement-interpretation, fail-fast on preconditions
- `ANNOUNCE` — print plan + Assumptions ledger, create task folder, confirm with user
- `PM_PHASE` — spawn Product Manager, produce `prd.md`
- `PRD_REVIEW` — user reviews PRD; approve or revise loop
- `TL_PHASE` — spawn Tech Lead, produce `engineering-design-doc.md` + `task-breakdown.md`
- `EDD_REVIEW` — Distinguished Engineer reviews engineering design doc; ≤3 cycle cap (F2-edd)
- `EDD_APPROVAL` — user approves EDD + task breakdown before build
- `BUILD_PHASE` — direct spawning per task breakdown; parallel where independent
- `REVIEW_PHASE` — builder reviewers in parallel; ≤3 cycle cap (F2-review)
- `SHIP_GATE` — single ship gate via `ask-options`; presents up to five verbatim options (`Commit + push + open PR` / `Commit + push` / `Commit only` / `Hold feedback` / `Done — no commit`). The first option is conditional on the current branch not being the repo's default branch; when it would be a PR from base → base, the option is omitted and the remaining four are shown in order
- `DONE` — terminal; emit final report
- `ABANDON` — terminal; emit abandon summary

**Reading guide**: each state's `Exit conditions` list is the authoritative source for transitions out of that state. There is no separate top-level transition map — when you need to know "where does this go next?", read the `Exit conditions` block on the current state.

---

## State: VALIDATE

**Entry condition**: skill invoked with `$ARGUMENTS`.

**Precondition check (fail-fast)**: before any other VALIDATE behavior, evaluate each item in the Preconditions section in order. If any precondition fails, halt immediately and print a clear error naming the missing precondition. Do not proceed to `ANNOUNCE`. Emit the precondition-check telemetry event (see Telemetry — Event 0) with `trigger=preconditions:ok` on success or `trigger=preconditions:fail:<name>` on failure, regardless of outcome.

**Body**:

Read the request. Apply the [Requirement Interpretation](skills/requirement-interpretation.md) rule to every term in the request whose interpretation could change which user sees what, which code path runs, or which data gets touched. Resolve each term per the rule for later capture in the Assumptions ledger (state `ANNOUNCE`).

**Scope note**: "Skip clarifying questions" mode (when the user has opted out of mid-flow questions) applies to workflow friction — preferences, naming, ordering. It does NOT authorize silent guesses on requirement semantics. Requirement-semantic ambiguities still go in the Assumptions ledger; stop-and-ask still fires when an unsurfaced interpretation could change user-visible behavior.

**Context decay check (per PERSONA)**: if the request maps to an existing product slug, check `.velo/products/<slug>/context.md`. If it is older than 30 days OR predates multiple completed tasks, fire F6.

**Exit conditions**:
- Preconditions pass, request understood → (auto) → `ANNOUNCE`
- Precondition fails → (failure:preconditions) → halt (terminal `preflight-failed`)
- F6 fires → see F6 handling
- F7 fires (user asks Velo to write code) → see F7 handling

**Failure modes**: can trigger F6, F7.

---

## State: ANNOUNCE

**Entry condition**: `VALIDATE` passed all preconditions and resolved request interpretation.

**Body**:

Produce a **plan** (which agents, in what order) and an **Assumptions ledger** (every term in the request you had to interpret).

**Derive task slug**: from the feature name — lowercase, spaces and special characters replaced with hyphens, trimmed. Example: "User Authentication Flow" → `user-authentication-flow`.

**Create task folder** before spawning any agent:
```
mkdir -p .velo/tasks/<slug>
```

All planning artifacts for this task live in `.velo/tasks/<slug>/`. Pass the full folder path to every agent.

Print the announcement using this template:

```
Velo here. Starting new work...

Feature: <one-line summary of what's being built>
Task folder: .velo/tasks/<task-slug>/

Assumptions (flag if wrong):
- <term from request> → <interpretation/signal>
- (write "(none)" only if every term in the request resolves to exactly one obvious signal)

Plan:
- Product Manager: <what they'll explore/decide>
- Tech Lead: <reads PRD + codebase, writes engineering design doc, gets approval>
- DB Engineer: <schema changes> (after engineering design doc approved, if needed)
- BE Engineer: <endpoints to implement> (after DB)
- Infra Engineer: <infrastructure changes> (if needed, parallel with BE)
- FE Engineer: <UI to build against engineering design doc> (parallel with backend)
- ...

Execution: PM → Tech Lead (spec audit + EDD, approval gate) → Build (backend stream + FE stream in parallel) → Review
```

Per the PERSONA hard rule "Always ask before delegating", wait for the user. If the user revises, re-render. If the user approves, proceed to `PM_PHASE`.

**Exit conditions**:
- User approves plan → (user-gate: approve) → `PM_PHASE`
- User has changes → (user-gate: revise) → re-render announcement
- User cancels → (user-gate: cancel) → `ABANDON` (terminal `cancelled-validate`)

**Failure modes**: can trigger F7.

---

## State: PM_PHASE

**Entry condition**: `ANNOUNCE` plan approved by user.

**Body**:

**This phase is mandatory.** Do not skip it.

1. Read `agents/product-manager.md`.
2. Spawn the Product Manager with:
   - The feature description
   - The task folder path: `.velo/tasks/<slug>/`
   - Explicit instruction to run the **full** product context retrieval flow (Step 0 of the PM Workflow): list `.velo/products/`, match the brief, read the matching `context.md` if found; if ambiguous ask the user to pick; if no match ask the user for a slug before creating, and at session end append decisions and write `product.txt` into the task folder.
   - Explicit instruction that `prd.md` MUST open with an `## Assumptions (flag if wrong)` section. Apply the [Requirement Interpretation](skills/requirement-interpretation.md) rule to every term from the brief whose interpretation could change which user sees what, which code path runs, or which data gets touched — each entry as `<term> → <interpretation/signal>`. Write `(none)` only if every term in the brief resolves to exactly one obvious signal. Pass through any assumptions Velo already flagged in the announcement. If the PM revises or rejects any assumption Velo flagged in the announcement, the PRD's Assumptions section is authoritative — note the divergence in that section. Velo's announcement Assumptions are superseded by the PRD's on conflict (this is the F8 path; see failure-mode table).
3. Outputs: `.velo/tasks/<slug>/prd.md` (with Assumptions section at the top), `.velo/tasks/<slug>/product.txt` with the resolved product slug.

**Do not proceed until `prd.md` is written.**

**Token tracking**: after the PM returns, note `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms`. Compute approximate cost through `report-cost`.

**Exit conditions**:
- `prd.md` exists → (auto) → `PRD_REVIEW`
- PM revises/rejects a Velo-announced assumption → (failure:F8) → note divergence in PRD; `prd.md` is authoritative; proceed to `PRD_REVIEW`
- Spawn unavailable or fails → (failure:F1) → halt and report blocker
- User aborts → (user-gate: abandon) → `ABANDON` (terminal `abandoned-user`)

**Failure modes**: can trigger F1, F5, F7, F8.

---

## State: PRD_REVIEW

**Entry condition**: `PM_PHASE` produced `prd.md`.

**Body**:

Use `ask-options` to present the PRD for approval:
- **Header**: `"PRD Review"`
- **Question**: `"I've written the PRD at .velo/tasks/<slug>/prd.md. Here's a summary: [2–3 bullet summary of goals, user stories, and scope]. Assumptions: [the PRD's Assumptions list, or '(none)']. Ready to proceed to engineering design doc?"`
- **Options**:
  - `Approved, proceed to engineering design doc`
  - `I have changes`
  - `Abandon`

If the user has changes: convey them to the PM for revision, wait for the updated `prd.md`, then re-present.

**Do not proceed until the PRD is explicitly approved.**

**Cycle-cap note**: user-driven revisions are uncapped. F2 applies only to reviewer-driven rework loops. `PRD_REVIEW`, `EDD_APPROVAL`, and `SHIP_GATE` all allow unlimited user revisions.

**Exit conditions**:
- `Approved, proceed to engineering design doc` → (user-gate: approve) → `TL_PHASE`
- `I have changes` → (user-gate: revise) → re-spawn PM with changes inline → `PM_PHASE` (revision); on return → `PRD_REVIEW`
- `Abandon` → (user-gate: abandon) → `ABANDON` (terminal `abandoned-prd-review`)

**Failure modes**: can trigger F1, F7.

---

## State: TL_PHASE

**Entry condition**: `PRD_REVIEW` approved.

**Body**:

1. Read `agents/tech-lead.md`.
2. Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/prd.md` — you will pass the contents inline.
3. Spawn the Tech Lead with:
   - The task folder path: `.velo/tasks/<slug>/`
   - The full contents of `prd.md` embedded directly in the prompt (do not ask the agent to read it — provide it inline)
   - Instruction to read the existing codebase for conventions and constraints
   - **Explicit reminder to run TL's Step 0 — spec-quality-check** on `prd.md` BEFORE any EDD work. If TL returns `STATUS: SPEC_REWORK_NEEDED`, TL stops without writing any files and returns the findings list inline. This is the spec-quality F8 variant — see Exit conditions.
   - Explicit instruction that `engineering-design-doc.md` MUST include an `## Assumptions (flag if wrong)` section. Apply the [Requirement Interpretation](skills/requirement-interpretation.md) rule to every technical interpretation made when translating the PRD into design — terms whose meaning could change which code path runs, which data gets touched, or which contract the team commits to. Each entry as `<term> → <interpretation/signal>`. Write `(none)` only if every term resolves to exactly one obvious signal. If the EDD discovers a PRD assumption is wrong (e.g. the technical reality contradicts a product-level interpretation), STOP and notify Velo before continuing — the PRD must be revised first. Do not silently override PRD assumptions in the EDD.
4. Outputs: `.velo/tasks/<slug>/engineering-design-doc.md` (with Assumptions section included) and `.velo/tasks/<slug>/task-breakdown.md`.

**Validate Tech Lead output**: before proceeding, verify both files exist:
- `.velo/tasks/<slug>/engineering-design-doc.md`
- `.velo/tasks/<slug>/task-breakdown.md`

If either is missing — **stop**. Print:
```
Tech Lead did not produce [missing file]. Cannot proceed to review.
Re-spawn Tech Lead with the same inputs and explicit instruction to produce both files.
```
Re-spawn Tech Lead, wait for both files, then re-validate before continuing.

**Token tracking**: after the TL returns, note `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms`. Compute approximate cost through `report-cost`.

**Exit conditions**:
- Both files exist → (auto) → `EDD_REVIEW`
- TL returns `STATUS: SPEC_REWORK_NEEDED` from Step 0 spec-quality-check → (failure:F8) → loop back to `PM_PHASE` with findings inline; PM revises `prd.md`; on return → `PRD_REVIEW` → `TL_PHASE`. No files written this cycle.
- TL flagged PRD assumption wrong → (failure:F8) → loop back to `PM_PHASE` with the contradiction inline; on PM revision → `PRD_REVIEW` → `TL_PHASE`
- Spawn unavailable or fails → (failure:F1) → halt and report blocker
- User aborts → (user-gate: abandon) → `ABANDON` (terminal `abandoned-user`)

**Failure modes**: can trigger F1, F5, F7, F8.

---

## State: EDD_REVIEW

**Entry condition**: `TL_PHASE` produced both `engineering-design-doc.md` and `task-breakdown.md`.

**Body**:

1. Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/prd.md` — you will pass the contents inline.
2. Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/engineering-design-doc.md` — you will pass the contents inline.
3. Read `agents/distinguished-engineer.md` → spawn Distinguished Engineer with both file contents embedded directly in the prompt (do not ask it to read files — provide contents inline).

Wait for the reviewer to return. Track cycle count starting at 1.

**Cycle counter on re-entry**: when `EDD_REVIEW` is re-entered from `EDD_APPROVAL` (user requested changes), the cycle counter resets to 1.

- If DE returns **APPROVE** → proceed to `EDD_APPROVAL`.
- If DE returns **REVISE** and cycle < 3 → collect the critique. Spawn Tech Lead with the feedback and what was already attempted in previous cycles. Wait for revised `engineering-design-doc.md` and `task-breakdown.md`. Re-validate both files exist. Increment cycle count and re-run the Distinguished Engineer.
- If DE returns **REVISE** and cycle == 3 → fire F2-edd (per-phase cap == 3 for `EDD_REVIEW`).

**Token tracking**: after each subagent returns, note `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms` and compute approximate cost through `report-cost`.

**Exit conditions**:
- DE returns APPROVE → (auto) → `EDD_APPROVAL`
- Cycle < 3 with REVISE → (auto) → loop within `EDD_REVIEW` (re-spawn TL + DE)
- Cycle == 3 with REVISE → (failure:F2) → F2-edd: see F2 handling
- Spawn unavailable or fails → (failure:F1) → halt and report blocker

**Failure modes**: can trigger F1, F2 (per-phase cap = 3), F7.

---

## State: EDD_APPROVAL

**Entry condition**: `EDD_REVIEW` reported DE APPROVE (or user accepted F2-edd override).

**Body**:

Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/task-breakdown.md` before presenting.

Use `ask-options` to present the engineering design doc and task breakdown for approval:
- **Header**: `"Engineering Design Doc Review"`
- **Question**: `"The engineering design doc passed review. Summary: [list key endpoints and top 3 decisions]. Assumptions: [the EDD's Assumptions list, or '(none)']. Task breakdown: [list tasks in order with owners]. Ready to proceed to build?"`
- **Options**:
  - `Approved, proceed to build`
  - `I have changes`
  - `Abandon`

If the user has changes: convey them to the Tech Lead for revision, re-run the Distinguished Engineer, then re-present.

**Do not proceed to build until both the engineering design doc and task breakdown are explicitly approved.**

**Exit conditions**:
- `Approved, proceed to build` → (user-gate: approve) → `BUILD_PHASE`
- `I have changes` → (user-gate: revise) → re-spawn TL with changes inline → `TL_PHASE`; on return → `EDD_REVIEW`
- `Abandon` → (user-gate: abandon) → `ABANDON` (terminal `abandoned-edd-review`)

**Failure modes**: can trigger F7.

---

## State: BUILD_PHASE

**Entry condition**: `EDD_APPROVAL` approved both EDD and task breakdown.

**Body**:

Read the task breakdown and planning artifacts to determine execution order and parallelism:
- Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/task-breakdown.md`
- Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/prd.md`
- Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/engineering-design-doc.md`

Execute tasks in the order defined by `task-breakdown.md` — directly. Do not hand off to `/velo:task`. Parallelism, dependency ordering, and `track-tasks` lifecycle follow [Velo Parallelism](skills/velo-parallelism.md). Same lifecycle rules apply in `REVIEW_PHASE`.

Each builder receives (all embedded directly in the prompt — do not ask them to read files):
- The task folder path: `.velo/tasks/<slug>/`
- Their specific task from `task-breakdown.md` inline
- The full contents of `prd.md` inline
- The full contents of `engineering-design-doc.md` inline
- Context on what completed tasks have delivered (if relevant)

**Token tracking**: after each subagent returns, note `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms` and compute approximate cost through `report-cost`.

**Descope monitoring**: triggers and procedure per [Velo Descope Ritual](skills/velo-descope-ritual.md). Fire F3 / F4 as appropriate.

**Exit conditions**:
- All tasks in `task-breakdown.md` complete → (auto) → `REVIEW_PHASE`
- Builder flags scope confusion → (failure:F3) → see F3 handling
- Agent count exceeds expected → (failure:F4) → see F4 handling
- Spawn unavailable or fails → (failure:F1) → halt and report blocker
- User aborts → (user-gate: abandon) → `ABANDON` (terminal `abandoned-user`)

**Failure modes**: can trigger F1, F3, F4, F5, F7.

---

## State: REVIEW_PHASE

**Entry condition**: `BUILD_PHASE` reports all tasks complete.

**Body**:

Before spawning reviewers, read both planning artifacts so you can pass contents inline:
- Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/prd.md`
- Read `.velo/tasks/<slug>/engineering-design-doc.md`

Spawn ALL relevant reviewers **in parallel** per [Velo Parallelism](skills/velo-parallelism.md), including the mandatory reviewer pairing defined there. Each reviewer receives (embedded directly in the prompt — do not ask them to read files):
- The full contents of `prd.md` and `engineering-design-doc.md` inline
- Their specific domain scope (what files/changes to review)

**Rework loop**: after all reviewers return, check verdicts. Track cycle count starting at 1. Maintain a running list of unresolved findings across cycles.

**Cycle counter on re-entry**: when `REVIEW_PHASE` is re-entered from `SHIP_GATE` (user provided feedback), the cycle counter resets to 1.

- If **all pass** → proceed to `SHIP_GATE`.
- If **any fail** and cycle < 3:
  - Collect findings from failing reviewers. Classify by severity: Critical / Significant / Minor.
  - **Cycle 1**: builders fix all Critical + Significant issues.
  - **Cycle 2**: builders fix remaining Critical issues only — skip Significant if already attempted.
  - Pass builders: the unresolved findings inline + what was attempted in previous cycles + full `prd.md` and `engineering-design-doc.md` inline.
  - Re-spawn only the failing reviewers with instruction: *"Re-check only the previously flagged issues — do not perform a full re-review."*
  - Increment cycle count and repeat.
- If **any fail** and cycle == 3 → fire F2-review (per-phase cap == 3 for `REVIEW_PHASE`).

**Token tracking**: after each subagent returns, note `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms` and compute approximate cost through `report-cost`.

**Exit conditions**:
- All reviewers pass → (auto) → `SHIP_GATE`
- Cycle < 3 with failing reviewer → (auto) → loop within `REVIEW_PHASE` (re-spawn builder + reviewer)
- Cycle == 3 with failing reviewer → (failure:F2) → F2-review: see F2 handling
- Spawn unavailable or fails → (failure:F1) → halt and report blocker

**Failure modes**: can trigger F1, F2 (per-phase cap = 3), F7.

---

## State: SHIP_GATE

**Entry condition**: `REVIEW_PHASE` reported all reviewers passing.

**Body**:

Apply the single ship-gate pattern per [Velo Approval Gates](skills/velo-gates.md#ship-gate-commit--optional-push--optional-pr) with header `"Ship approval"` and question `"All reviewers passed. [Summary of what was built and review cycles taken.] How do you want to ship?"`.

Resolve the repo's default branch at gate time per [Velo Approval Gates — Base-branch detection](skills/velo-gates.md). Compare against the current branch:
- If the current branch is NOT the default branch, present all five verbatim options in this order: `Commit + push + open PR` / `Commit + push` / `Commit only` / `Hold feedback` / `Done — no commit`.
- If the current branch IS the default branch, omit `Commit + push + open PR` (a PR from base → base is meaningless) and present the remaining four in order: `Commit + push` / `Commit only` / `Hold feedback` / `Done — no commit`.

Each option label names every action it triggers, satisfying PERSONA's per-action approval rule for the bundled sequence.

On `Commit + push + open PR`: run strictly ordered commit → push → PR.
1. Spawn the `commit` agent (default mode).
2. On commit success, run `git push`.
3. On push success, spawn the `commit` agent in PR mode (pass `mode: pr` in `$ARGUMENTS` along with the current branch name and the repo's default branch as the base). The agent analyzes commits since the base branch, drafts a PR title and body, runs `gh pr create`, and returns the PR URL. The commit agent's PR-mode workflow delegates to [PR Protocol](skills/pr-protocol.md) for title derivation, body templates, idempotency, and `gh pr create` invocation; this state does not duplicate PR-protocol logic inline.
4. On full success → `DONE` (terminal `delivered-and-committed-and-pushed-and-pr-opened`).

On `Commit + push`: spawn the `commit` agent (default mode); on commit success, run `git push`; on push success → `DONE` (terminal `delivered-and-committed-and-pushed`).

On `Commit only`: spawn the `commit` agent (default mode); on success → `DONE` (terminal `delivered-and-committed`).

**Do not commit until an option that names commit is explicitly chosen.**

**Token tracking**: after the commit agent returns (for any path that spawns it), note `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms` and compute approximate cost through `report-cost`.

**Exit conditions**:
- `Commit + push + open PR` → (user-gate: commit-push-pr) → spawn `commit` agent; on success run push; on push success spawn `commit` agent in PR mode; on PR success → `DONE` (terminal `delivered-and-committed-and-pushed-and-pr-opened`)
- `Commit + push` → (user-gate: commit-push) → spawn `commit` agent; on success run push; on push success → `DONE` (terminal `delivered-and-committed-and-pushed`)
- `Commit only` → (user-gate: commit) → spawn `commit` agent; on success → `DONE` (terminal `delivered-and-committed`)
- `Hold feedback` → (user-gate: feedback) → treat it as rework input: spawn the relevant builder(s) with the feedback inline, re-run affected reviewers → `REVIEW_PHASE` (cycle counter resets to 1)
- `Done — no commit` → (user-gate: skip-commit) → `DONE` (terminal `delivered-no-commit`)
- Commit agent fails (any path) → (failure:F1) → use `ask-options`: `Retry commit` / `Route to /velo:hunt to investigate` / `Abandon`. F1 still fires for telemetry; the option choice drives the next transition. `Retry commit` re-runs the commit agent with the same arguments; on subsequent success the chosen path continues (push, then PR if applicable). `Route to /velo:hunt to investigate` hands off via `handoff-mode` to `/velo:hunt` with the commit failure inline as the brief. `Abandon` → `ABANDON` (terminal `abandoned-ship-gate`).
- Push fails (on `Commit + push` or `Commit + push + open PR`) → (failure:F1) → halt. **The F1 report MUST surface "local commit landed — push failed, retry manually or revert" so the user knows the side effect.**
- PR step fails on `Commit + push + open PR` after commit AND push both succeeded → (failure:F1) → halt and surface that the commit and push landed and that the PR can be retried manually with `gh pr create`.
- User selects `Abandon` (e.g. on a commit-failure re-prompt) → (user-gate: abandon) → `ABANDON` (terminal `abandoned-ship-gate`)

**Failure modes**: can trigger F1, F7.

---

## State: DONE

**Entry condition**: any of four arrival paths from `SHIP_GATE`:
- `Done — no commit` (terminal `delivered-no-commit`)
- `Commit only` and commit succeeded (terminal `delivered-and-committed`)
- `Commit + push` and push succeeded (terminal `delivered-and-committed-and-pushed`)
- `Commit + push + open PR` and commit + push + PR creation all succeeded (terminal `delivered-and-committed-and-pushed-and-pr-opened`)

**Body**:

Print the final-report template from [Velo Final Report](skills/velo-final-report.md). Skill ends.

**Exit conditions**: terminal.

**Failure modes**: none — terminal sink for successful completion.

---

## State: ABANDON

**Entry condition**: any of:
- User selects "Abandon" or "Cancel" at any interaction prompt
- User types "abandon", "stop", or "cancel" mid-flow
- F2 cap reached at any phase and user chose "Abandon"
- F3 / F4 descope ritual resolved with "Abandon"
- F5 cross-task dependency surfaced and user chose to halt

**Body**:

Print a short abandon summary: phase reached, artifacts produced (PRD, EDD, task-breakdown), what was attempted, what was left, and any commits that landed. No file written.

**Exit conditions**: terminal. Skill ends.

**Failure modes**: none — terminal sink for failures that route here.

---

## Templates

### Plan announcement (ANNOUNCE)

```
Velo here. Starting new work...

Feature: <one-line summary of what's being built>
Task folder: .velo/tasks/<task-slug>/

Assumptions (flag if wrong):
- <term from request> → <interpretation/signal>
- (write "(none)" only if every term in the request resolves to exactly one obvious signal)

Plan:
- Product Manager: <what they'll explore/decide>
- Tech Lead: <reads PRD + codebase, writes engineering design doc, gets approval>
- DB Engineer: <schema changes> (after engineering design doc approved, if needed)
- BE Engineer: <endpoints to implement> (after DB)
- Infra Engineer: <infrastructure changes> (if needed, parallel with BE)
- FE Engineer: <UI to build against engineering design doc> (parallel with backend)
- ...

Execution: PM → Tech Lead (spec audit + EDD, approval gate) → Build (backend stream + FE stream in parallel) → Review
```

### Final report (DONE)

The final-report template lives in [Velo Final Report](skills/velo-final-report.md). This command consumes that skill in place of an inlined template; do not duplicate the template body here.

---

## Failure modes

F-code definitions and standard handling are in [Velo Failure Modes](skills/velo-failure-modes.md). This command can trigger F1–F8. State headers cross-reference by ID; failures that fire from a state appear on that state's `Failure modes` line.

**Command-specific F2 parameterization**: F2 fires at cycle 3 of the per-phase rework counter. Per-phase caps: `EDD_REVIEW` = 3 (F2-edd), `REVIEW_PHASE` = 3 (F2-review). Cycles 1 and 2 are automatic rework attempts; cycle 3 fires F2. When F2 fires, the `ask-options` header names the phase (e.g. `"EDD review cap reached"`); `Accept as-is and proceed` routes to the next-phase state: `EDD_REVIEW` → `EDD_APPROVAL`, `REVIEW_PHASE` → `SHIP_GATE`.

**F8 variants used here**:
- From `PM_PHASE`: PM revises or rejects a Velo-announced Assumption → PRD is authoritative; note divergence in `prd.md`'s Assumptions section; continue to `PRD_REVIEW`.
- From `TL_PHASE` (assumption divergence): EDD discovers a PRD assumption is wrong → STOP; loop back to `PM_PHASE` with the contradiction inline; PRD must be revised first. PRD-revision cycle counter does not reset. Do not silently override PRD assumptions in the EDD.
- From `TL_PHASE` (spec quality): TL's Step 0 spec-quality-check returns blocking findings (`STATUS: SPEC_REWORK_NEEDED`) → STOP; loop back to `PM_PHASE` with findings inline; PM revises `prd.md`. Same loop semantics as the assumption-divergence variant — on PM revision → `PRD_REVIEW` → `TL_PHASE`.
